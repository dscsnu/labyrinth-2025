## Overview
This year's Labyrinth follows the theme of "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World." Teams must defeat seven bosses (representing the seven evil exes from the movie) by casting spells at various locations throughout the venue.

## Team Structure
- Teams consist of 4 members each
- Each team will battle against seven bosses
- The first six bosses `[0...5]` are randomly assigned to each team
- The seventh (final) boss is the same for all teams
- First team to defeat all seven evil exes wins the game

## Progression System
- Teams start with seven spells of differing attack strengths and difficulty
- Each spell has an associated **Attack Score**
- Each boss has a specific **XP** (experience points)
- To defeat a boss, teams must cast spells with a combined Attack Score greater than the boss's XP
- Successfully defeating a boss allows the team to progress to the next level

## Spell Mechanics
- After casting, spells enter a **cooldown** period for a specified number of levels
- Example: If a spell with a 2-level cooldown is used at level 3, it cannot be used again until after level 5

## Spell Casting Procedure
1. Teams must visit designated **Locations** marked with QR codes
2. Each spell requires creating a specific pattern by scanning QR codes
3. All team members must participate in scanning the QR codes to form the required pattern
4. Patterns require between 2-4 locations
5. Example: If a spell requires a square pattern, team members must scan QR codes at locations that form a square

## Winning Condition
The first team to successfully defeat all seven bosses (evil exes) wins the Labyrinth.
